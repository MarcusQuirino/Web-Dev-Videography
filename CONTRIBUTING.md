# Welcome to WEB DEV VIDEOGRAPHY contributing guide

Thanks for submiting a video for this repo!

I'll be quick

## Put the title of the video and link in markdown format

like this: 
[Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up (Official Music Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&pp=ygUXbmV2ZXIgZ29ubmEgZ2l2ZSB5b3UgdXA%3D)

## Make sure is in the correct category
it's kinda subjective so put where we think is more fiting

if that is not a category for it open a PR adding the category (but first give me a heads up just to be sure it's needed)

## Give it a brief description
mainly what makes that video good and why is a must what like: "the video that made my undestand RSC"

## Alternative (fast) method
just send me the link on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Marcus_filipus) or discord
